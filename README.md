Project Odin
Recipe Website - HTML Project
Introduction
This project is aimed at practicing and applying fundamental HTML knowledge by building a basic recipe website. The website will include a main index.html page that links to several individual recipe pages. Each recipe page will contain structured content, such as ingredients, preparation steps, and other relevant information.

The goal of this project is to focus purely on the structure and organization of the content using HTML. Although the website may not be visually appealing at this stage, it provides an essential foundation for future styling improvements using CSS.

Skills Demonstrated
By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

Creating well-structured and semantic HTML content.
Using basic HTML tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
Organizing a multi-page website with internal links between pages.
Writing clean and readable HTML code.
Implementing good HTML practices such as proper use of headings, sectioning elements, and file organization.
This project serves as an introduction to web development and lays the groundwork for further learning and enhancement with CSS and JavaScript in future projects.
